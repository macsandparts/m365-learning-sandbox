# Microsoft 365 Learning Sandbox

This repository supports my personal learning journey as I prepare for the **Microsoft 365 Certified: Fundamentals (MS-900)** exam and explore modern Microsoft 365 development topics.

## Goals

- Understand Microsoft 365 services, licensing models, and productivity tools
- Explore **Microsoft Graph** and its integration into apps
- Test and prototype **Copilot for Microsoft 365** use cases
- Simulate environments using the **Microsoft 365 Developer Program**

## Topics I'm exploring

- Microsoft Teams extensibility
- SharePoint Framework (SPFx)
- Microsoft Graph API basics
- Copilot scenarios and limitations
- Power Platform integration (Power Automate & Power BI)

## Motivation

I'm working primarily on **personal projects and prototyping scenarios** to gain practical understanding of how Microsoft 365 services integrate with each other and how automation and AI (Copilot) can enhance productivity.
